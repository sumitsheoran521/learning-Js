/\*\* Modules:-

- 1.  Reuseable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details.
- 2.  Usually a standalone file, but it doesn't have to be.
-
- Why Modules?
- Compose software: Modules are small building blocks that we put together to build complex application.
- Isolate components: Modules can be developed in isolation without thinking about the entire codebase.
- Abstract code: Implement low-level code in modules and import these abstractions into other modules.
- Organized code: Modules naturally lead to a more organized codebase.
- Reuse code: Modules allow us to easily reuse the same code, even across multiple projects.
